OVERVIEW
==================

This project is an android mobile game. In this game, blocks are placed into a window by the player, to balance in a pile, in real time.
The pile balances on a fulcrum - until it falls.

OBJECTIVE
==================

The tower will grow as one start placing blocks on it, until it cannot balance, and falls.

The player needs to make the tower as high as he or she can before the tower falls. The player's score is the height of the tower he/she builds.

FEATURES
==================

A multiplayer mode, in which a player can compete with a second player. In this case, the player who fails to survive (i.e. whose last placed block leads to the falling of the pile) loses.
